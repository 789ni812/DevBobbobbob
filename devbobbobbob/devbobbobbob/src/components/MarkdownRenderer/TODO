# MarkDown Renderer:

    [] Read all my markdown files
         under the (00Project-Reference-Library\00MyVsNotes)
         [ ] @research how to scan a directory and list the file contents (we only require markdown files if that helps.)

            ```
                const fs = require('fs')

                const dir = '/Users/flavio/folder'
                const files = fs.readdirSync(dir)

                for (const file of files) {
                console.log(file)
                }
            ```

        [ ] Check out the project reference folder
         into a subfolder inside the src folder 
        (create-react-app stops files from being imported outside of the src folder) 
        [ ] Research How to list files
         in the 00project-reference.... directory 
        [ ] implement listing of files
